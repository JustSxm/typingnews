# 🧠 Typing News

**Typing News** is a small experimental project where I tried something new: *vibe coding*.  
Instead of following a rigid plan or spec, I just vibed with an idea and let the code flow — no pressure, just creativity.

This project was also my first time using [**v0**](https://v0.dev) by Vercel — an AI UI generation tool that helped kickstart the layout and structure with natural language prompts. I wanted to see how far I could go by just jamming with the idea and letting v0 do some of the UI heavy lifting.

## 📰 What's the idea?

The concept is simple:  
A minimal, distraction-free interface that displays typing practice exercises based on real news headlines or short news content. It's kind of like typing tests meets current events.

Whether you're brushing up on your keyboard skills or just want to read news in a different way — Typing News makes it a bit more interactive.

## 🚧 Status

This is still a **work-in-progress**, and mostly a playground for experimentation.  
There might be rough edges — that's part of the charm.

## ⚙️ Built With

- 💻 [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) – for quick and AI-assisted UI scaffolding  
- 🧠 My vibes – no rigid specs, just going with the flow  
- 🛠️ Likely Next.js or basic React (depending on how far I take this)

---

## 🙌 Why?

Just wanted to build something cool without overthinking it.  
Vibe coding lets creativity lead, and tools like v0 make the process feel effortless.
